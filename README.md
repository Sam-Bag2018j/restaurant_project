# Project Overview
This is the final project "Restaurant Reviews Project" of front end web developer nanodegree course of udacity. I have given static version of this project and I have to convert this version to be accessible for screen readers use, responsive on different devices screen sizes, and owrk offline by adding service worker.  


## specification:
I had given the restaurant reviews code that had alot of issues. It wasn't responsve for mobile devices.  It also didn't had any acceibilty features, and didn't work offline. I had to fix all these issues.
